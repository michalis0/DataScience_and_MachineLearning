The underlying assumption is that two words sharing similar contexts also share a similar meaning and consequently a similar vector representation from the model.\n",

        "\n",
        "Word2vec gives astonishing results. Its ability to maintain a semantic relationship is reflected in a classic example where if you have a vector for the word \"King\" and you remove the vector represented by the word \"Man\" from the \"King\" and add \"Woman\", you get a vector that is close to the vector \"Queen\":\n",
        "- King - Man + Woman = Queen\n",

        "Second example: \"dog\", \"puppy\" and \"pup\" are often used in similar situations, with similar surrounding words like \"good\", \"fluffy\" or \"cute\", and according to Word2vec they will therefore share a similar vector representation.\n",
        "\n",
        "In real applications, Word2vec models are created from billions of documents. For example, [Google's Word2Vec model](https://code.google.com/archive/p/word2vec/) is formed from 3 million words and phrases.\n",

While Word2vec models represent tokens (word) with a single vector, BERT generates different output vectors for a same word when used in different context.
