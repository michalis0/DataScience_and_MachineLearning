        "**Lemmatization** is a way of dealing with the fact that while words like connect, connection, connecting, connected, etc. are not exactly the same, they all have the same essential meaning: connect. The differences in spelling have grammatical functions in spoken language, but for machine processing, those differences can be confusing, so we need a way to change all the words that are forms of the word connect into the word connect itself.\n",
        "\n",
        "One method for doing this is called **stemming**. Stemming involves simply lopping off easily-identified prefixes and suffixes to produce what is often the simplest version of a word, the root. Connection, for example, would have the -ion suffix removed and be reduced to connect. This kind of simple stemming is often all that is needed, but lemmatization — which actually looks at words and their roots (called lemma) as described in the dictionary — is more precise (e.g feet -> foot).\n",

        "Word embedding approaches use deep learning and neural network-based techniques to convert words into corresponding vectors so that semantically similar vectors are close to each other in an N-dimensional space, where N refers to the dimensions of the vectors. The underlying assumption is that two words sharing similar contexts also share a similar meaning and consequently a similar vector representation from the model.\n",

        "- [GloVe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GloVe) (Global vectors for Word Representation), by Stanford\n",
        "\n",
        "Word2vec gives astonishing results. Its ability to maintain a semantic relationship is reflected in a classic example where if you have a vector for the word \"King\" and you remove the vector represented by the word \"Man\" from the \"King\" and add \"Woman\", you get a vector that is close to the vector \"Queen\":\n",
        "- King - Man + Woman = Queen\n",
        "\n",
        "Second example: \"dog\", \"puppy\" and \"pup\" are often used in similar situations, with similar surrounding words like \"good\", \"fluffy\" or \"cute\", and according to Word2vec they will therefore share a similar vector representation.\n",
        "\n",
        "In real applications, Word2vec models are created from billions of documents. For example, [Google's Word2Vec model](https://code.google.com/archive/p/word2vec/) is formed from 3 million words and phrases.\n",

        "GloVe is an extension of Word2vec. More information [here](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/).\n",

        "Recently, more advanced models have been developed, such as [BERT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BERT_(language_model)) - Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers-  and [GPT-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-3) - Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3. While Word2vec models represent tokens (word) with a single vector, BERT generates different output vectors for a same word when used in different context. You can find further readings on the topic at the end of this notebook."
