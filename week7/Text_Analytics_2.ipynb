        "Word embediing approaches use deep learning and neural network-based techniques to convert words into corresponding vectors so that semantically similar vectors are close to each other in an N-dimensional space, where N refers to the dimensions of the vectors. The underlying assumption is that two words sharing similar contexts also share a similar meaning and consequently a similar vector representation from the model.\n",

Its ability to maintain a semantic relationship is reflected in a classic example where if you have a vector for the word \"King\" and you remove the vector represented by the word \"Man\" from the \"King\" and add \"Woman\", you get a vector that is close to the vector \"Queen\". \n",
