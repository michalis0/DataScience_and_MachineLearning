# Classification

In this week's lab we are going to cover the following topics:

- Logistic Regression, a well known method to learn a classification model
- Normalizing numerical features of a dataset before fitting a model
- Encoding categorical features 
- Train and test accuracy to evaluate a classification model
- Precision and Recall, a metric which shows how good our model is in predicting a class label
- Confusion matrix


Some points will be pretty useful for the second part of the assignment. 

### To Do
Follow the notebook [Classification_Logistic_Regession.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/github/michalis0/DataMining_and_MachineLearning/blob/master/week6/Classification_Logistic_Regression.ipynb) to learn how to build a complete classification pipeline from scratch.

Have a look at the two exercise notebooks proposed to gain further insight.
