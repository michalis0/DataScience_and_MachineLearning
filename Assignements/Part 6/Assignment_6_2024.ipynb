    "\n",
    "Your investigation has narrowed down the suspects to three individuals. To assist you in tracking the rogue agent, SIMF has developed a new tool: the SIMF Signal Interceptor (M5Stack). This device is designed to connect to the suspects' IoT devices and retrieve critical data, such as the device IDs and IP addresses they are using. However, during its initial deployment, the Signal Interceptor appears to be malfunctioning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your first mission is to repair the critical functions of this tool so it can help you identify and track the rogue agent.\n",

    "https://europe-west6-monjoor.cloudfunctions.net/function-assignment-6/SIMF_UserIDToDeviceID\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The request should include the `userID` in the headers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Response Handling**:\n",
    "   - Once you have the response from the API, think about how you can process the data. What method would help you convert the response into a format you can work with, and how would you extract the device ID from that data?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Testing**:\n",
    "   - As with the previous function, testing the API directly with `curl` can help you understand the data returned by the API. You could simulate a request to check the response format and structure.\n",
