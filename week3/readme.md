# Pandas and Exploratory Data Analysis

This week, we are going to learnhow to do Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) which is a very important step in every data science project. Exploratory data analysis is an approach to analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often with visual methods. A statistical model can be used or not, but primarily EDA is for seeing what the data can tell us beyond the formal modeling or hypothesis testing task. Exploratory data analysis was promoted by John Tukey to encourage statisticians to explore the data, and possibly formulate hypotheses that could lead to new data collection and experiments [source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploratory_data_analysis)].

## What we will cover
This week we are going to cover more advanced operations with pandas, mainly:

- Different ways of Visualizing statistical features of a dataset
- Filtering a dataset
- Aggregating data with pandas
- Joining two datasets
- More advanced visualization (e.g, Maps)

## To Do
- The notebook ["EDA and Data visualization.ipynb"](https://colab.research.google.com/github/michalis0/DataMining_and_MachineLearning/blob/master/week3/EDA_and_Data_visualization.ipynb) presents two examples of EDA on real world datasets: New York city resturant inspections and vehicle collision data from New York Police Department.

- Follow the notebook ["Advanced_Pandas.ipynb"](https://colab.research.google.com/github/michalis0/DataMining_and_MachineLearning/blob/master/week3/Advanced_Pandas_Operations_Aggregation.ipynb) to learn how to do more advanced aggregation in pandas.

- The notebook ["Advanced_Pandas_Operations_Merge.ipynb"](https://colab.research.google.com/github/michalis0/DataMining_and_MachineLearning/blob/master/week3/Advanced_Pandas_Operations_Merge.ipynb) shows different ways of joining two datasets.

- The notebook ["More_Visualization.ipynb"](https://colab.research.google.com/github/michalis0/DataMining_and_MachineLearning/blob/master/week3/More_Visualization.ipynb) shows two examples of advanced visualization with pandas.
