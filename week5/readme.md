# Linear Regression

In this week's lab we are going to cover the following topics:
- Splitting the data to train and test sets.
- Using __sklearn__ package to solve a linear regression problem.
- Scaling the data using a StandardScaler
- Encoding categorical features using One Hot Encoder
- What's adjusted R^2 

Plan of the day:
- Walkthrough of the slides "Regression tips and tricks.pdf"
- Exercise ["regression_exercise.ipynb"](regression_exercise.ipynb)
- Individual work on the assignment


## To Do

- Fill in the notebook "regression_houses.ipynb" as an exercise to test your skills in solving a linear regression problem.
- If you're interested in the implementation from scratch of Gradient Descent and its functioning, but also additional facts like overfitting, regularization and cross-validation you can use the notebook ["Linear_Regression_Derivation.ipynb"](https://colab.research.google.com/github/michalis0/DataMining_and_MachineLearning/blob/master/week5/Linear_Regression_Derivation.ipynb) and the Demo of Gradient Descent (Optional material but supa dupa interesting!)

## To remember
- There is a summary pdf ["linear_regression_summary.pdf"](linear_regression_summary.pdf) which could be useful for you.
