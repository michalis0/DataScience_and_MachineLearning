- Logistic Regression, a well known method to learn a classification model
- Normalizing numerical features of a dataset before fitting a model
- Encoding categorical features
- Train and test accuracy to evaluate a classification model
- Precision and Recall, a metric which shows how good our model is in predicting a class label
- Confusion matrix
- Visualizing the decision boundary of a simple classifier
