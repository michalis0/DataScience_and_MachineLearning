# Linear Regression

In this week's lab we are going to cover the following topics:
- Splitting the data to train and test sets.
- Using __sklearn__ package to solve a linear regression problem.

(- What is over fitting? What is regularization?)
- Cross-validation, the standard way of hyper-parameter tuning in ML

## To Do

- Fill in the notebook "regression_students.ipynb" as an exercise to test your skills in solving a linear regression problem.
- 
- If you're interested in the implementation from scratch of Gradient Descent, you can use the notebook ["Linear_Regression_Derivation.ipynb"](https://colab.research.google.com/github/michalis0/DataMining_and_MachineLearning/blob/master/week5/Linear_Regression_Derivation.ipynb) (Optional material)
