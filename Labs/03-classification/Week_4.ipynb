    "We now move from regression another important branch of machine learning: classification. As the name indicates, the idea is to classify items of a dataset into **predefined classes** for which labelled data is already available.\n",

    "Classification is similar to regression, but instead of predicting a continuous target, classification algorithms attempt to apply a discrete number of labels or classes to each observation.\n",

    "While in a regression the targets are generally numerical and continuous-valued, oftentimes the targets in classification are categorical.  \n",

    "However, classification can be applied in settings where the target is numerical. For example, we might want to predict whether the unemployment rate for a country will be low, medium, or high, but do not care about the actual number. In such cases, determining the \"optimal\" way to categorize our target variable might require some creativity, and it is important to properly justify our assumptions.\n",

While the Gradient Descent rely on the gradient (first-order derivatives) to update our parameters, Newton's method also makes use of the [Hessian matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hessian_matrix), i.e., the second-order derivatives. Newton's method generally converges faster than Gradient Descent. However, Newton's method is computationally-expensive and the Hessian might not even exist. Hence, numerical methods called [Quasi-Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasi-Newton_method), such as BFGS, have been developed to solve optimization problems.  "

    "### 4.1 Intuition <a id=\"kNN-Intuition\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "The k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) algorithm is a simple, yet powerful machine learning technique that predicts the label of a data point by looking at the 'k' closest labeled data points and letting them vote on what label the query point should have. It is inherently a lazy learning algorithm as it does not explicitly learn a model. Instead, it memorizes the training dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary principle behind kNN is that similar things exist in close proximity. In other words, similar data points are near to each other in the feature space. The proximity or closeness of points is calculated using distance measures such as Euclidean, Manhattan, or Minkowski distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider an example where we want to classify whether a customer will buy a product or not. If we choose k=3, the algorithm looks at the three nearest neighbors of a customer to determine the purchasing behavior based on the majority vote of the neighbors' purchasing statuses.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:990/1*3SwcOCUyVdGauhHrHvOaLA.png' width=\"500\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm is versatile and can handle both classification and regression tasks but is predominantly known for its application in classification. It’s easy to implement and understand but becomes significantly slower as the size of the data in use grows.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits of kNN:**\n",
    "- No assumptions about the data — no need to build a model, tune several parameters, or make additional assumptions.\n",
    "- Adapts easily to real-time data.\n",
    "- Very easy to implement for multi-class problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Drawbacks of kNN:**\n",
    "- The algorithm gets significantly slower as the number of examples and/or predictors/independent variables increase.\n",
    "- Sensitive to the scale of the data and irrelevant features.\n",
    "- Poor performance on imbalanced datasets.\n",
    "- It requires a good definition of what it means for two points to be close or similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "**To improve kNN performance:**\n",
    "- Pre-processing data with scaling can bring improvement.\n",
    "- Choosing the right value of k is crucial — too low a value of k can be noisy and lead to effects of outliers, while a high value makes computation expensive and might also include points from other classes.\n",
    "- Weighted kNN can help if some types of votes are more important than others.\n",
    "  \n",
    "For more in-depth understanding and practical applications of kNN, consider reading [K-Nearest Neighbor by Anthony Christopher](https://medium.com/swlh/k-nearest-neighbor-ca2593d7a3c4) which offers further insights and examples."

While this data can be very informative, most machine learning algorithms require numerical input and output variables. Thus, converting categorical data into a form that could be provided to ML algorithms to do a better job in prediction is essential.
