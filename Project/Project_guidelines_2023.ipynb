        "To test what you learned in the class, we will hold a competition. You will create a classifier that predicts how the level of some text in French (A1,..., C2). The team with the highest rank will get some goodies in the last class (some souvenirs from tech companies: Amazon, LinkedIn, etc).\n",

        "You have decided to form a startup called “LingoRank” with your University friend and become a millionaire. You have until the end the semester to create a proof of concept for your investors. Your startup will revolutionize the way people learn and get better at a foreign language.\n",
        "\n",
        "### THE IDEA\n",
        "You have noticed that to improve one’s skills in a new foreign language, it is important to read texts in that language. These texts have to be at the reader’s language level. However, it is difficult to find texts that are close to someone’s knowledge level (`A1 to C2`). You have decided to build a model for English speakers that predicts the difficulty of a French written text. This can be then used, e.g., in a recommendation system, to recommend texts, e.g, recent news articles that are appropriate for someone’s language level. If someone is at A1 French level, it is inappropriate to present a text at B2 level, as she won’t be able to understand it. Ideally, a text should have many known words and may have a few words that are unknown so that the person can improve.\n",

        "You can find the training data and the unlabeled test data in the Data tab.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 🚀 SUBMISSION\n",
        "As you build your model and train it on the training data, you can generate predictions for the ( unlabelled ) test data. Make sure that your submission file has the same format as the `sample_submission.csv` file in the Data tab. Once you are sure about your model and satisfied with the prediction accuracy you got on your own test data, you can try to generate predictions for the actual test data and submit it to the competition.\n",
        "\n",
        "As soon as you make a submission you can see the prediction accuracy and your ranking on the leaderboard. Note that you can only make 5 submissions per day. To know more about the competition rules, check out the rules tab.\n",

        "- data cleaning (maybe not so important in this dataset, but try!)\n",
        "- data augmentation (sentence features, e.g., length, [cognates](https://www.fluentin3months.com/french-cognates/), POS, etc),\n",
        "- use [text embeddings](https://huggingface.co/blog/getting-started-with-embeddings) (Bert, RoBerta, etc). That's your best bet for boosting prediction accuracy. First use a [static embeddings](https://www.kaggle.com/code/matleonard/word-vectors/notebook). Then you can use an embedding and post-train it ([transfer learning](https://spacy.io/usage/embeddings-transformers)) with our own data labels. This should give you (ideally!) the best results.\n",
        "\n",
        "More ideas for those that wish to go the extra mile:\n",
        "- Make an application that searches and ranks French YouTube videos using the captions.\n",
        "- Create an interpretable model that highlights the difficulty of the words/phrases.\n",
