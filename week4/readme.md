# Pandas and Exploratory Data Analysis

This week, we are going to learnhow to do Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) which is a very important step in every data science project. Exploratory data analysis is an approach to analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often with visual methods. A statistical model can be used or not, but primarily EDA is for seeing what the data can tell us beyond the formal modeling or hypothesis testing task. Exploratory data analysis was promoted by John Tukey to encourage statisticians to explore the data, and possibly formulate hypotheses that could lead to new data collection and experiments [source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploratory_data_analysis)].

## Walk-throughs we will cover
This week we are going to cover more advanced operations with Pandas, mainly:

- Visualizing statistical features of a dataset: The notebook ["EDA and Data visualization.ipynb"](EDA_and_Data_visualization.ipynb) or [(direct link)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/michalis0/DataMining_and_MachineLearning/blob/master/week4/EDA_and_Data_visualization.ipynb)

- Aggregating data with Pandas: The notebook ["Advanced_Pandas_Operations_Aggregation.ipynb"](Advanced_Pandas_Operations_Aggregation.ipynb)

- Joining or merging two datasets: The notebook ["Advanced_Pandas_Operations_Merge.ipynb"](Advanced_Pandas_Operations_Merge.ipynb) 

## To Do at Home

There's A LOT of useful material in this week's folder! Make sure to check everything.

- More advanced visualization (e.g, Maps): The notebook ["More_Visualization.ipynb"](More_Visualization.ipynb) shows examples of plotting maps with Pandas.

- Test what you have learned by doing some [Exercises](Exercises).

- More detailed step-by-step tutorials [Other_tutorials](Other_tutorials)
