# Introduction to Pandas and Data Cleaning
In week 2 you will learn how to use [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), a fast and powerful library for data analysis and manipulation in Python.

## Lab structure
- 2 walkthroughs including a couple of practical exercises:
   - Go through [this notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/michalis0/DataMining_and_MachineLearning/blob/master/week2/Basic_Pandas_Load_File.ipynb) to learn how to **load datasets** in different formats (csv, json) into a Pandas dataframe
   - Follow [this notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/michalis0/DataMining_and_MachineLearning/blob/master/week2/Data_Cleaning_in_Pandas.ipynb#scrollTo=eqLRUv6UF1jC) to review how to do **data cleaning** with Pandas.
   
- brief intro to the [Data Cleaning in Pandas Summary Sheet](https://github.com/michalis0/DataMining_and_MachineLearning/blob/master/week2/DataCleaning%20in%20Pandas%20Summary.pdf)

## What will be covered?

- load a CSV and JSON file to a Pandas dataframe
- do some basic selection/filtering operations with Pandas (columns and rows)
- convert columns datatypes
- remove rows with null/missing values

## To Do [at home]:

- Follow [this notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/michalis0/DataMining_and_MachineLearning/blob/master/week2/Loading_Data_WebAPI.ipynb) to learn how to obtain data from a web api.

- Complete all the walkthroughs and exercises in the "Selecting Subsets" folder. This is a more detailed presentation than during the lab. By going over these notebooks you will learn how to filter your dataframe by rows or columns and also how to select a subset of a dataframe. So make sure to do so, as these operations are very important in data analysis. (_Note that you should load the data with the raw links from Github if you want to run these notebook in colab_)

- Complete these tutorials in Kaggle about [data cleaning](https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/data-cleaning-challenge-handling-missing-values).
