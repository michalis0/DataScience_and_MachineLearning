# Introduction to Pandas
In week 2 you will learn how to use [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), a fast and powerful library for data analysis and manipulation in Python.

## What will be covered?

We will cover:

- load a csv and JSON file to a Pandas dataframe
- do some basic selection/filtering operations with pandas (columns and rows)
- filtering by rows
- filtering by columns
- convert columns datatypes to proper datatype
- remove rows with nulls

## To Do:

- Go through [this notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/michalis0/DataMining_and_MachineLearning/blob/master/week2/Basic_Pandas_Load_File.ipynb) to learn how to load datasets in different formats (csv, json, etc) into pandas dataframe

- follow [this notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/michalis0/DataMining_and_MachineLearning/blob/master/week2/Loading_Data_WebAPI.ipynb) to learn how to obtain data from a web api.

- follow [this notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/michalis0/DataMining_and_MachineLearning/blob/master/week2/Data_Cleaning_in_Pandas.ipynb#scrollTo=eqLRUv6UF1jC) to review how to do data cleaning with pandas.

- (at home) Complete all the walkthroughs and exercises in the "Selecting Subsets" folder. By going over these notebooks you will learn how to filter your dataframe by rows or columns and also how to select a subset of a dataframe. So make sure to do so, as these operations are very important in data analysis. (_Note that you should load the data with the raw links from Github if you want to run these notebook in colab_)

- (at home) Complete these tutorials in Kaggle about [data cleaning](https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/data-cleaning-challenge-handling-missing-values). You can also review the functions that are relevant [here](https://github.com/michalis0/DataMining_and_MachineLearning/blob/master/week2/DataCleaning%20in%20Pandas%20Summary.pdf).
